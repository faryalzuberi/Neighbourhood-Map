# Neighbourhood-Map
## Description
This web application is written in Javascript using the Knockout js framework and jQuery library. It loads a map centered on Karachi, Pakistan and displays several points of interest using Google Map markers. Information regarding these places is fetched from the Foursquare Places API using hardcoded Latitude Longitude strings in the app. This information is displayed in a google maps InfoWindow whenever a location marker or its equivalent list item in the side navigation is clicked.
All user interactions with the side navigation is handled via ko observables.
## Installation
The application can be run by opening the index.html file in any browser.
